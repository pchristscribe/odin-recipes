    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p class="funky-color"> My friend Ritchie owned a restaurant down in Rehoboth, DE and served me the absolute best Beef Stroganoff that I
        had ever had. I wanted to be able to make it myself but he told me that it was a recipe that he would take to
        his grave! I have spent years trying to recreate it. This is my best effort thus far! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lbs Sirloin Roast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Hot Paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespooon Avocado Oil</li>
        <li>3 Shallots</li>
        <li>1 lb Mushrooms, cleaned and cut into quarters</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire Sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup Creme Fraiche</li>
        <li>1 lb Egg Noodles</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry Sauvignon Blanc</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons Dijon Mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Freshly Grated Horseradish</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Cut the beef against the grain into ½-inch slices, pound lightly, then cut those slices into 1-inch-wide
            strips.</li>
        <li>Add the flour, paprika, 1½ teaspoons salt and 1½ teaspoons pepper to a large shallow bowl and toss to
            combine. Dredge the strips of meat in the flour mixture, shake them to remove excess flour, then transfer
            them to a rimmed baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Place a large skillet over high heat and swirl in the oil. When the oil begins to shimmer, sauté the beef
            slices, in two batches,
            until they are well browned on both sides but rare inside, 3 to 4 minutes per batch. Transfer the seared
            meat to the baking sheet.
            Turn the heat down slightly.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon of the butter to the pan. When it has melted and started to foam, add the mushrooms, toss
            to coat them with the fat, and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms
            have released their moisture and are a deep, dark brown, 12 to 15 minutes. About halfway into the process,
            add the sliced shallots and 1 tablespoon butter and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>While the mushrooms cook, add the noodles to the boiling water, and cook until just done, about 10 minutes.
            Drain the noodles, and toss with the remaining 2 tablespoons butter. Set aside.</li>
        <li>When the mushrooms and shallots are soft and caramelized, deglaze the pan with the Sauvingon Blanc, scraping
            at all the stuck-on bits on the pan's surface. When the wine has reduced by about half, slowly stir in the creme
            fraiche, followed by the Worcestershire and mustard. Add the meat, along with any accumulated juices, and stir to
            combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the dish is hot and the beef is medium-rare, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in
            the horseradish. Taste, and adjust the seasonings.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
