    <h3> Description</h3>
    <p class="funky-color">This is the meatloaf I started making when I was just a teenager loosely based off one from the restaurant that I
        worked in. It's a perennial family favorite! It's wonderful sliced cold the next day and used in a warm, toasted
        sandwich with a slice of provolone and a little butter.</p>
